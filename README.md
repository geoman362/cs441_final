# Campus Survival Game

Campus Survival Game will be a randomly generated college survival game that hinges off of the allocation of resources for each day. The player will have meters for health, sanity, coolness and relationships, which they must try to maintain amidst an increasingly unfair workload consisting of homeworks, tests, and resume-building activities. The game will continue forever to simulate the endless seeming crunch effect of college on an unsuspecting student.


A day will have 8 - 12 productive hours. Doing more than 8 hours of work will cause your health and sanity to go down, which increases the chances of developing stress related mental problems or getting sick.

You can also choose to spend the last 4 hours partying which will still decrease your health but will raise your coolness, sanity and relationships.

Each weekday also has classes which will take up an hour of your time each. You can choose to skip classes but this will make your chance of success on the next few homeworks and the next test cumulatively lower for each skipped class.

Some classes will have extremely strict attendance policies ranging from just losing points off your grade to failing if you miss more then two lectures. 

Some classes will also force you to do many hours of outside-of-class "volunteer" work to be abe to pass.

At the end of each 3 months your gpa will be updated. If your gpa goes below 2.0, you lose. If your health or sanity go below 0, you lose.

Having sanity that is too low will cause mental breaks. Symptoms can include, not going to class, not doing any work, being forced to go out tonight. 

Having a good relationship stat prevents sanity loss. Having a good coolness stat causes relationship stat to go up quickly, but, if you are too cool, you risk one night stands, which continue to raise coolness, but lower sanity and risks stdebuffs.
